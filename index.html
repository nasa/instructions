        <p>
            This GitHub organization is intended to publicly host NASA code that has
            been
            SRA-approved for open source.
            You can review the SRA (software release authority) process for
            getting
            open-source approval on
            <a href="https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide">https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Who">Instructions: Who Can Be a Member</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Only NASA staff can be a member of the NASA org on github.com and
                release code in
                <a href="https://github.com/nasa">github.com/nasa</a> org.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a NASA civil servant or contractor and would like to be added to the Public
            NASA
            GitHub Org, you will need to
            submit the <strong>AGCY NASA Github Collaborator Form</strong> NAMS
            request
            (<a href="https://nams.nasa.gov">https://nams.nasa.gov</a>). 
            This requires you to be behind the NASA firewall.
            If you were a member several years ago and recently found you are no
            longer a member, please see this 
            <a href="https://github.com/nasa/nasa.github.io/issues/2">note</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only members have rights to directly edit code in a github.com/nasa
            repository. Everyone else will need
            to submit a pull request. <strong class="highlight-red">We highly encourage
pull requests from the public!!!</strong>
            However, please note that not all repositories are actively
            maintained.</p>
        <p>Members of the public can not attain and do not need collaborator
            status.
            You don't need any special status to submit pull requests or add
            issues.</p>
        <h3 id="How">How</h3>
        <p>
            For information on how to become a member of the NASA Org (you need
            to be
            a NASA civil servant or
            contractor with access to systems inside the NASA firewall), please
            see
            the instructions on
            <a href="https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide">code.nasa.gov/#/guide</a>.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            Employees or contractors of another federal agency that are working closely on a code project and absolutely
            need collaborator status can get collaborator status by attaining a <a href="https://guest.nasa.gov/">NASA guest account</a>.
            Please use your gov piv identity if possible. Your NASA contact can than request collaborator status for you in the NAMs system.</p>
        -->
        <h2 id="instructions" style="margin-top:2em;">Instructions: Once 
            You Are a Member</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure mandatory policies are followed, NASA org members are not
            given
            the full admin rights you might be used
            to on your personal github.com accounts. However, by using teams,
            team
            owners, collaborators, and outside collaborators
            roles we can make the experience pretty quick and easy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="owners">Org Owners</h3>
        <p>Only org owners have the ability to create new repositories and bring
            new
            users in as members of the NASA github org. </p>

        <p>We currently have two active owners in the org:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Taylor Yates (<a href="mailto:evan.t.yates@nasa.gov">evan.t.yates@nasa.gov</a>)</li>
            <li>Justin Gosses (<a href="mailto:justin.c.gosses@nasa.gov">justin.c.gosses@nasa.gov</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="repos">Repos</h3>
        <p>
            We do not give out admin rights on any NASA Github repos for reasons
            stated above. If you want a new repo created or
            want to edit settings on an existing repo that require admin access,
            please contact one of our org owners. Without admin
            rights on a repository, you'll still be able to make any code
            changes
            yourself as long as you're a collaborator on that
            repository or a member of a team whose participants are
            collaborators by
            default.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you need for a new repository (and it has gotten SRA approval)
            please
            either submit a modification to your NAMs request
            or email one of the Org Owners with the follwing information:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Name of the repository</li>
            <li>SRA number</li>
            <li>Team name for managing the repository</li>
            <li>Usernames of people for that team if it doesn't already exist.
                Usernames must be from the list of existing NASA org members.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you are joining for the first time and need a repository created,
            you
            can also include the same information in your NAMs request
            for access inside the more information box.
        </p>
        <p> 
            You can learn more about the software release authority process on
            the Guide page of
            <a href="https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide"> code.nasa.gov</a>.
        </p>


        <h3 id="teams">Teams</h3>
        <p>
            Teams are effective ways of managing repository access privileges
            for
            an entire group of users. Only org owners can create and
            remove teams, but we now allow users to be team maintainers. Team
            maintainers have permissions to add and remove users to their
            teams from the population of people who are already NASA org
            members.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Team maintainers are <em>technically</em> able
            to add a user who was once in the NASA org back onto their team
            (thus
            reinstating the user in the org). However, we <strong>do not allow
                this</strong> and will remove maintainers who are found in
            violation. If you need a past member to be reinstated in the org,
            contact an org owner and request to be added as an outside
            collaborator.</p>

        <h3 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h3>

        <p>Github also has a role called "collaborator". This is someone who
            doesn't have repository ownership or admin rights but can push edits
            to code directly without doing a pull request.</p>
        <p>If you would like to add a NASA staff member who is a member of the
            NASA org as a collaborator on a single repository, we still suggest
            you contact the NASA org owners mentioned above about setting up a
            TEAM for that single repository instead of adding people one by one.
            Teams result in less requestes (and therefore waiting) on NASA org
            owners for actions. We are sorry you don't have normal full
            ownership
            rights. It is because everyone with write access needs to be
            approved
            NASA user. If you had normal repository owner right, you could add
            any
            github user.</p>


        <h3 id="outsidecollaborators">Outside Collaborators</h3>
        <p>Only on a rare case-by-case basis we will allow non-NASA users to be
            added to the org as Outside Collaborators. You can collaborate
            without
            this status via forks, branches, and pull-requests. If you fork a
            repository, you can make changes and then submit back a
            pull-request.
            A repository maintainer can then approve those changes. You do not
            need formal outside-collaborator status for this!</p>

        <p>Please reach out to us if you have any questions.</p>

        <h3 id="common">Common Request & Process Combinations</h3>

        <h3> Why is NASA's Open Source Code in multiple locations?</h3>
        <p>The reason for NASA open source code existing in different places
            boils down to different requirements, both requirements of those
            writing the code and requirements from above.</p>
        <h4>Other NASA orgs on github.com or gitlab.com or bitbucket</h4>
        <p>Although NASA staff are highly encouraged to release open source
            software on github.com/nasa as that is where most people look so it
            ensures higher potential reuse, they are not absolutely required to
            use that org account. A common reason code may exist under other orgs
            is that the software is jointly maintained by non-NASA persons or
            the
            code was developed by non-NASA persons through a NASA grant.</p>
        <p>To encourage disoverability, please use the <a
                href="https://github.com/search?q=nasa&type=topics">#NASA topic
                tag</a>
            on any GitHub or GitLab repositories not under github.com/nasa.</p>
        <h4>Discovering useful NASA Open-Source Code via metadata catalogs</h4>
        <p>There are several hundred NASA open-source code repositories and as previously noted, not everything is on github.com/nasa. 
            To improve your chance of finding something useful to you, 
            we suggest you use code.nasa.gov and software.nasa.gov.
            These sites host metadata descriptions
            for nearly all of the officially open-sourced code.</p>
        <h4><a href="https://code.nasa.gov">Code.nasa.gov</a></h4>
        <p>Code.nasa.gov feeds into https://code.gov, which holds open source
            code from across all federal government agencies. It is mandated by
            Congress and only holds standardized metadata about the code.</p>
        <p>Code.nasa.gov only shows open-source software. For government-source
            and patented software, see software.nasa.gov</p>
        <p class="highlight-red"><strong>Please make sure any repos added to github.com/nasa
            are also tracked in code.nasa.gov!</strong></p>
        <p>Code.nasa.gov uses both human and A.I. generated tags to help users find NASA open source that is useful for their goals.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://software.nasa.gov">Software.nasa.gov</a></h4>
        <p>Software.nasa.gov is part of the larger <a
                href="https://technology.nasa.gov/">https://technology.nasa.gov/</a>
            that also covers patents and spinoffs. The NASA's Technology
            Transfer
            Program ensures that innovations developed for exploration and
            discovery are broadly available to the public, maximizing the
            benefit
            to the Nation. Whether you're looking to start a new company,
            enhance
            an existing product, or create a new product line, you can gain a
            competitive edge in the marketplace by putting NASA technology to
            work
            for you.</p>
        <p>The information on software.nasa.gov is presented in a way that
            leverages NASA's technology taxonomy, so if you want to see an
            aggregate view of NASA software categories, it is a good place to
            visit.</p>
        <p>It also includes some older software products that are only available
            as downloadable zip files as well as software that must be requested
            individually as they are only open to US persons or are tied to a
            patent.</p>
